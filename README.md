# Swiggy MySQL Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **Swiggy's food delivery dataset** using MySQL to extract key business insights. The goal is to answer **business-related questions** that help improve sales, customer retention, and operational efficiency.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Sales & Revenue Analysis**: Identify top-performing restaurants, revenue trends, and peak order hours.
- **Customer Behavior & Retention**: Analyze customer preferences, repeat orders, and churn rates.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Evaluate delivery performance, order fulfillment rates, and logistics optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Data Analysis**: SQL queries for insights and reporting

## üìÇ Database Schema
The project consists of the following key tables:
- **Customers** (`CustomerID`, `Name`, `Location`, `RegistrationDate`, `TotalOrders`)
- **Orders** (`OrderID`, `CustomerID`, `RestaurantID`, `OrderDate`, `OrderAmount`, `DeliveryTime`, `Status`)
- **Restaurants** (`RestaurantID`, `Name`, `CuisineType`, `Location`, `Rating`)
- **Delivery Partners** (`PartnerID`, `Name`, `Experience`, `AvgDeliveryTime`)
- **Menu Items** (`ItemID`, `RestaurantID`, `ItemName`, `Category`, `Price`)

## üìä SQL Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total number of customers
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM Customers;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Restaurant with the most menu items
```sql
SELECT r.Name, COUNT(m.ItemID) AS total_items
FROM Restaurants r
JOIN Menu_Items m ON r.RestaurantID = m.RestaurantID
GROUP BY r.Name
ORDER BY total_items DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Total revenue generated by each restaurant
```sql
SELECT r.Name, SUM(o.OrderAmount) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Restaurants r ON o.RestaurantID = r.RestaurantID
GROUP BY r.Name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 customers with the highest total spending
```sql
SELECT c.Name, SUM(o.OrderAmount) AS total_spent
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Most ordered menu item
```sql
SELECT m.ItemName, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS order_count
FROM Orders o
JOIN Menu_Items m ON o.RestaurantID = m.RestaurantID
GROUP BY m.ItemName
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Orders placed in June 2024
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orders_in_june
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-30';
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Average order value (AOV)
```sql
SELECT AVG(OrderAmount) AS average_order_value FROM Orders;
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Delivery person with the most deliveries
```sql
SELECT d.Name, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS total_deliveries
FROM Orders o
JOIN Delivery_Partners d ON o.OrderID = d.PartnerID
GROUP BY d.Name
ORDER BY total_deliveries DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Number of pending deliveries
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pending_orders FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Pending';
```

### üîü Cuisine type generating the most revenue
```sql
SELECT r.CuisineType, SUM(o.OrderAmount) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Restaurants r ON o.RestaurantID = r.RestaurantID
GROUP BY r.CuisineType
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 11Ô∏è‚É£ Number of customers from each city
```sql
SELECT Location, COUNT(CustomerID) AS total_customers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Location;
```

### 12Ô∏è‚É£ City generating the highest revenue
```sql
SELECT c.Location, SUM(o.OrderAmount) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.Location
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
